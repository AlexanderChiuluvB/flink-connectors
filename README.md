# Pravega Flink Connectors

Connectors to read and write [Pravega](http://pravega.io/) streams with [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org/) stream processing applications.

Build end-to-end stream processing pipelines that use Pravega as the stream storage and message bus, and Apache Flink for computation over the streams.


## Features & Highlights

  - **Exactly-once processing guarantees** for both reader and writer, supporting **end-to-end exactly-once processing pipelines**

  - Seamless integration with Flink's checkpoints & savepoints

  - Parallel readers and writers supporting high throughput and low latency processing

## Documentation
See the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/pravega/flink-connectors/wiki) for documentation on how to build and use the Flink Connector library.
